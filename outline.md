# Course outline

This will be a seminar course on Astrophysical Dynamics under the *PHYS 633 Seminar in Astrophysics 2* course number. The course will provide an introduction to different topics in dynamics from across astrophysics, such as planetary, stellar, or galactic dynamics, mergers, binary evolution, tides, etc., as well as how to model dynamical systems using the [REBOUND code](https://rebound.hanno-rein.de/) (and other codes as appropriate).

## Time and place

Winter term 2026. Class will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1-2.30pm in the Piano room on the 2nd floor of Rutherford.

**First organizational meeting: Wednesday 7th January, 1pm, in the Piano room**

## List of topics

The topic for the course, "Astrophysical Dynamics", has deliberately been chosen to be broad so that it overlaps with many different research areas. We will decide on a list of topics at the first meeting, depending on what people are most interested in, but some possible topics are:

- Resonant interactions between planets
- The dynamics of black hole mergers
- Dynamics of star clusters. Violent relaxation, core collapse
- How to integrate accurately. Symplectic integration
- Relativistic corrections in pulsar binaries
- Planetary migration
- The restricted three-body problem: tadpole and horseshoe orbits, trojans
- Tides: orbital evolution, tidal heating
- Chaos and the evolution of systems over large times
- Formation and evolution of dark matter halos
- Dynamical friction and applications such as orbital decay of globular clusters
- Evolution of interacting binary stars
- Tidal disruption events around supermassive black holes; supermassive black hole growth


## Format

We will discuss a different topic every week. The first class will be a short summary of the topic based on the reading followed by discussion. The second class will be a numerical exercise that illustrates the topic.

We will divide into pairs and, starting from Week 4, each pair of students will take charge of one or two weeks of the class (depending on the total number of students, TBD at the first meeting). You will be responsible, with the help of the course instructor, for assigning reading for the week, giving the summary and running the discussion, and for coming up with a numerical exercise.

## McGill policy statements

McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic oﬀences under the [Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures](https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/code_of_student_conduct_and_disciplinary_procedures.pdf) (approved by Senate on 29 January 2003) (See McGill's guide to academic honesty](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest) for more information).

In accord with McGill University's [Charter of Students' Rights](https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/charter_of_student_rights_last_approved_october_262017.pdf), students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French written work that is to be graded. This does not apply to courses in which acquiring proficiency in a language is one of the objectives.

In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University's control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.
