# Week 1: The Two-Body Problem

## Reading

Chapter 2 of [Murray and Dermott](https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/40857034?datasource=library_web&search_field=all_fields&search=true&database=all&scope=wz%3A12129&format=&clusterResults=on&func=find-b&q=&topLod=0&queryString=solar%20system%20dynamics&find=Go)

## Reading questions

- what are the constants of motion for two-bodies in orbit around each other?
- what is meant by the term "mean motion"?
- sketch an elliptical orbit and label it
- what is the difference between mean anomaly, true anomaly, and eccentric anomaly?
- what is Kepler's equation?
- if you want to set up an orbit with semi-major axis a and eccentrity e, how do you choose the initial location and velocity?
- explain why, even though the Moon is tidally-locked, it appears to wobble (librate) to an observer on Earth
- underneath each of eqs (2.157) and (2.162), the text gives a brief physical explanation. Explain how the physical explanation gives rise to the equation in each case.

Answers to these questions should be submitted to your github repository *before* class on Monday.
