# PHYS 633 Astrophysical Dynamics

This is the website for PHYS 633 Seminar in Astrophysics 2, a graduate course at McGill University in the Winter term 2026. The course will provide an introduction to different topics in dynamics from across astrophysics, such as planetary, stellar, or galactic dynamics, mergers, binary evolution, tides, etc., as well as how to model dynamical systems using the [REBOUND code](https://rebound.hanno-rein.de/) (and other codes as appropriate).
