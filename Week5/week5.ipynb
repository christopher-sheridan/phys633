    "This notebook will start you off in Week 5. It sets up a disk of planetesimals with uniform surface density in circular orbits around a central star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "- The code starts up the built-in REBOUND [visualization web-server](https://rebound.hanno-rein.de/visualization/) with `sim.start_server(port=1234)`. If you go to http://localhost:1234 in your browser, you should see an animation of the particles as the simulation runs, together with some useful information such as the number of steps per second. Press 'h' on this screen to see a list of keyboard commands.\n",
    "- After the simulation ends, the code uses the stored particle positions to generate plots of particle positions at each timestep. You will need to `mkdir png` to create a directory for the png files. You'll find a shell script `images_to_movie.sh` in the main directory of the github repository that you can use to turn these png files in to a movie. The syntax is `images_to_movie.sh 'png/plot%3d.png' movie.mp4`. The script uses `ffmpeg` which you will need to install if you don't have it (I used `brew install ffmpeg`).\n",
    "- Because we have many particles, the forces are calculated using a tree code (`sim.gravity = \"tree\"`) in which far away particles are grouped together for the purposes of calculating the gravitational force. This improves how the simulation time scales with number of particles from $\\propto N^2$ to $\\propto N\\log N$ which gives a big speed up.\n",
    "- The tree code requires us to define a `boxsize` for the simulation. We use `'open'` boundary conditions, so that particles that leave the box are removed. If you look in the top left of the visualization window you will see that the total number of particles drops slightly over time as particles leave the simulation box.\n",
    "- We also set a softening length (`sim.softening = 0.01`) which softens the gravitational force at small separations (the interparticle potential is $\\propto 1/\\sqrt{r^2+\\epsilon^2}$ rather than $\\propto 1/r$). This avoids numerical errors that arise when two particles pass very close to one another and experience very large accelerations."
